A buddy wanted a website with upload, download, signup, signin, and payment functionality. That's a lot. So I said, sure!

# Things to add
You can always make things better. Adding PDFs to cloudinary and such was not so easy with React. I'll jump into that next time if I have more time. 
- transfer all frontend to React.js or Next.js
- tidy-up the user interface
- provide more robust authentication for the admin

# What did I learn?
Things are good, but things can be better. Use the technology to get the job done. There is no need for "over reaching" to get the job accomplished. Do I like EJS? Maybe... maybe not. But I've been building a lot with it. And it works! Don't be a code weenie.
